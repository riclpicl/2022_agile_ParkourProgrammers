    <h1>About our Calculations</h1>
    <h3>What is Goal Weight Change?</h3>
    <p>Reccomended Goal Weight change is calculated based upon your current weight, body fat percentage and goals.</p>
    <h3>What is a TDEE?</h3>
    <p> TDEE is short for total daily energy expenditure. In simpler term this is the number of calories one burns in a day. It is a good tool to compare intake of calories with how many may be burned in a day, and can then be used to adjust caloric needs based on goals. It is calculated by adding together basal metabolic rate, thermic effect of feeding, exercise energy expenditure, and non-exercise activity thermogenesis. Basal metabolic rate is the number of calories the body needs to function in a resting state. it can be calculated by multiplying the body weight in kilograms bt 20. Thermogenic effect of feeding is essentially how much energy is required to digest food that has been consumed. It is calculated by multiplying the BMR by 0.1. Exercise energy expenditure is the amount of energy one expends during exercise. It can range from 150 calories for light exercise to 500 for intense exercise. The same is true for  non-exercise activity thermogenesis, the number of calories a client burns in their everyday life outside of exercise.</p>
    <h3>What are Macros?</h3>
    <p>Macros, or Macronutrients are the building blocks of food. They are all necessary for building and maintaining the body. The three main nutrients are Protien, Fat and Carbohydrates. Protiens main jobs are to repair body tissues and build or regulate our skin, hair, muscle and bones. Dietary fats are essential to give your body energy and to support cell function. Fats help your body absorb some nutrients and produce hormones that are essential for daily functioning. Not all fats are created equal however, there are three distinct types: Saturated, Unsaturated and Trans Fats. Saturated fats and Trans fats are usually found solid at room temperature, such as butter or margarine, and are considered less healthy than Unsaturated based on their chemical structure and the correlation they have with choloesterol levels. Unsaturated fats are generally found liquid at room temperature such as olive oil or canola oil and are considered more healthy. There are also several types of carbohydrates starches, fiber and sugar. sugar is the simplest carbohydrate, and its main function is to provide energy to our cells. Starches are long chains of sugar that provide long lasting energy, fiber is similar, however it has bonds in these chains that our bodies cannot break so it acts as filler in our digestive tract. It is important to have all of these nutrients in our diets to maintain health and functionality of the body, but the ratios can change based on personal lifestyle, goals, and overall body composition.</p>
    <p>We calculate our percentages based on a macronutrient split. For most, a good split is approximately 15 to 35 percent protein, 40 to 60 percent carbohydrates, and 20 to 40 percent fat. We furthur specify protien needs based on activity level, body fat percentage, health goals and sex. We use the protien estimation to then calculate the leftover calories for each carbohydrate and fat percentage to a 60 percent carbohydrates and 40 percent fats recommendation.</p>
    <p>These calculations are just estimations as every body or metabolism is different. They are meant as helpful recommendations not harsh rules to follow.</p>
